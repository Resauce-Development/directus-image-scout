# Image Scout

> v3.0.0 Tested On Directus 9.18.1

## What is Image Scout?

Image Scout is an interface extension for Directus 9 developed by Resauce. A clean interface is provided allowing you to search multiple online image libraries to find images that suit your needs. When a provider is configured, the connection should be seamless, allowing you to easily find and use the image that you want or need in your project.

### Here's what image-scout looks like!

### Configuring URLs

Due to the Content-Security-Policy that Directus uses through the Helmet system, you will need to whitelist the URLs that the images will come from.

This means you will need to add the below configuration to your environment file, you can omit any URLs that you don't have configured.

## Learn More â€” What's a provider?

A provider is an online service that allows you to view and download images for use in your own project. The providers we have are listed below, to enable them, you must register an API key with the service then store that key in your Envrionment File.

If you have multiple providers enabled, you can decide which provider you would like to be the default provider by setting the `RIS_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` in your envrionemnt file

## Common Issues

I've come across a few issues, here's the issues and how to fix them.

### ðŸŽ¨ Failed to import image

This error usually comes along with ECONNREFUSED and a 500 status request to `/resauce-image-scout/providers/<provider>/download`

This happens when you are loading the app from a different URL to the one configured in your `HOST` entry in your `.env` file

### Refused to load the image '<URL>' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive

This occurs when you've failed to configure the URL in the `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_DIRECTIVES__IMG_SRC` variable required further up the documentation.

## Liability

Before activating any provider, ensure you have agreed to their terms and usage policy. You are subject to their usage terms based on how you use these images. No contributor to this repository accepts responsibility for the use of the images.
